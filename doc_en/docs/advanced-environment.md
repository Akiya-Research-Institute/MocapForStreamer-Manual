# Environment settings

## Background color

Change settings from `Background color` from the `Environment settings` menu on the left side of the screen.  
`A` means background transparency, and this setting works for [Video stream output by NDI](../how-to-use-export/#video-stream-output-by-ndi).

## Import media

Video or image sequence can be imported and displayed in the background.

### Import video

Drag & drop video file to MocapForStreamer window.

!!! Question "Suported extensions"
    .3g2, .3gp, .3gp2, .3gpp, .aac, .asf, .avi, .m2ts, .m4v, .mov, .mp4, .wmv

### Import image sequence

Image sequence can be imported and displayed as a flip-book animation.  
To import image sequence, place one or more image files in one folder that does not contain other files, and drag and drop one of the files into the MocapForStreamer window.  
Name the files, for example, "Image_01.png, Image_02.png, Image_03.png, ..." to ensure they play back in correct order.

    .png, .jpg, .bmp, .exr

!!! Question "To import still image"
    By placing only one image file in one folder, it can be loaded as practically a still image.  
    Set small value to the frame rate (for example 1/120) to minimize the resource usage.

### Adjust the display

In the `Environment settings` menu on the left side of the screen, you will see the name of the imported file and the operation panel.  
You can adjust the `position`, `orientation`, `size`, and `color`.  

For image sequences, you can also specify the `frame rate` of playback.
